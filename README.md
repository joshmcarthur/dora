Dora (the Explorer)
====

Dora (the explorer) is a searchable index of Github Explore&#39;s &#39;Trending Repositories&#39; over time

It consists of two components:

1. Scraper: The scraper examines Github's Explore page daily and records what it sees in MongoDB
2. Application: The application presents repository data stored in MongoDB on a very basic web page.


Future Changes:
---

* Add pagination
* Increase frequency of scraping if Heroku costs allow.
